# Banned AI Design Patterns

Comprehensive list of visual patterns that signal AI-generated interfaces. Avoid all of these.

## Layout Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Centered hero + three equal-width cards + centered CTA | The most common AI layout | Asymmetric layouts, split screens, bento grids |
| >60% of content using `text-align: center` | Center-heavy layouts are the #1 structural AI tell | Left-align body text, reserve centering for headings and CTAs only |
| Perfectly symmetric grids everywhere | Real design uses intentional asymmetry | Vary column spans, use dominant/subordinate relationships |
| Full-width sections stacked vertically with identical padding | Monotonous rhythm | Vary section widths, padding, and visual weight |
| Everything inside cards (border + shadow + white bg) | Card overuse dilutes hierarchy | Use `border-t`, `divide-y`, or negative space for separation |
| Cookie-cutter section rhythm (every section follows identical structure) | Monotonous, signals templated generation | Vary section types: hero, split, bento, full-bleed, editorial |
| Colored left-border accent cards | Common AI component pattern | Use top borders, background tints, or typography weight for emphasis |
| Bento grids with empty/dead cells | Missing `grid-flow-dense` lets grids render with visible gaps that read as broken | Apply `grid-auto-flow: dense` (Tailwind: `grid-flow-dense`); verify `col-span`/`row-span` values interlock mathematically; zero empty cells |

## Color Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Purple/violet gradients (`#6366f1`--`#8b5cf6` range) | The single most recognizable AI color signature | Pick a different palette entirely, then check the result against Composite Looks below -- the usual escapes (earth tones, monochrome, warm accents) land straight in one of them |
| Purple-to-blue gradient hero | The default AI aesthetic | Pick a different palette entirely |
| Evenly distributed accent colors | No visual hierarchy | One dominant accent, neutrals everywhere else -- but source the accent from the subject's own world, not the default acid-green or vermilion on near-black (Composite Looks below) |
| Generic blue (#3B82F6) as primary | Default Tailwind blue | Choose a distinctive hue with personality |
| Oversaturated accent colors (saturation >80%) | Visually loud, cheap feel | Desaturate accents; muted tones read as more considered |
| Pure black (`#000000`) for text or backgrounds | Harsh, unnatural contrast | Use near-blacks (`#0a0a0a`, `#111`) or tinted darks |
| Rainbow gradient text | Screams "AI made this" | Single-color text, use weight/size for emphasis |
| Excessive `bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r` on headings | Gradient text overuse is an AI tell when applied to multiple headings | Reserve for one hero moment at most |
| Neon/outer glow effects (`shadow-[0_0_20px_...]`) | Dated, screams template | Subtle, tinted shadows that match the surface hue |
| Warm AND cool grays in the same interface | Inconsistent tinting | Pick one gray family and commit |

## Composite Looks

The rows above ban individual tokens. These three ban whole *combinations* that pass every per-token rule and still arrive unprompted regardless of subject -- each one is a legitimate structure (single accent on neutrals, restrained palette, editorial typography) collapsed onto the same realization every time.

| Look | Composition | Alternative |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Warm editorial | Cream ground near `#F4F1EA` + high-contrast serif display + terracotta accent | Keep the serif/neutral structure, move the ground and accent off the cream-terracotta pairing |
| Acid dark | Near-black ground + exactly one bright acid-green or vermilion accent | Keep one accent on neutrals; derive its hue from the subject rather than the default two |
| Broadsheet | Hairline rules + zero border-radius + dense newspaper columns | Keep the density; vary rule weight, radius, or column rhythm so all three do not co-occur |

Observed as of 2026-08. Treat as a dated list of over-used combinations, not a permanent ban -- if the brief pins one of these looks, follow the brief.

## Typography Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Inter/Roboto/System font everywhere | Zero personality | Distinctive choices: Geist, Outfit, Cabinet Grotesk, Satoshi |
| Uniform font-weight (400 regular everywhere) | Flat hierarchy | Weight contrast: 500/600 for headings, 400 for body |
| Title Case In Every Heading Word | Overly formal, AI tell | Sentence case |

## Decoration Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Accent line under every heading | Dead giveaway | Use typography weight and spacing for hierarchy |
| Decorative emoji in headers | Tacky | Quality icons (Phosphor, Radix) or no decoration |
| Uniform rounded corners everywhere (>80% of elements sharing the same `>=16px` radius) | Bubbly uniformity is an instant AI tell | Vary by purpose: sharp for data, rounded for interactive, pill for tags |
| Icons inside colored circles (primary-color background circle + white icon) | Default AI component decoration; #3 most common AI pattern | Use icons inline, or with subtle background tints matching the surface |
| `rounded-2xl` / `rounded-3xl` on containers, cards, and sections | Bubbly, toy-like feel | Reserve large radii for small interactive elements; use tighter radii for containers |
| Generic stock imagery | Placeholder feel | Contextual photos, SVG illustrations, or abstract graphics suited to the domain |
| Floating gradient blobs as background | Overused AI aesthetic | Noise textures, mesh gradients, geometric patterns |
| Custom mouse cursors (`cursor: url(...)`) | Novelty that signals template code | Use system cursors; reserve custom cursors for drawing tools or games |
| shadcn/ui components left in generic default state | Identifiably "template starter kit" | Customize colors, spacing, and radii to match the design system |

## Interaction Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Hover effect on every element | Noise, no hierarchy | Reserve hover for interactive elements only |
| Uniform transition-all on everything | Performance waste, lazy | Animate specific properties (transform, opacity) |
| Bounce animation on load | Juvenile | Staggered fade/translate reveals with spring physics |
| Skeleton loaders that look identical to content | Uncanny valley | Simpler placeholders or progressive loading |

## Content Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| "Welcome to X" / "Unlock the power of..." / "Revolutionize your..." hero copy | Generic AI copy; instant credibility killer | Write specific, benefit-driven copy tied to the actual product |
| "John Doe" / "Jane Smith" / "Sarah Chan" placeholder users | Lazy, unrealistic | Diverse, realistic names with messy data |
| "Acme Corp" / "Nexus" / "Synergy" startup slop names | Template feel, obviously generated | Industry-specific realistic names |
| Fake round numbers ("99.99%", "50%", "10x faster") | Suspiciously clean metrics signal fabrication | Use irregular numbers ("47.2%", "3.8x", "1,247") |
| Lorem ipsum visible in output | Unfinished | Realistic copy, even if placeholder |
| Broken Unsplash links (`source.unsplash.com` or expired URLs) | Renders as broken images, amateurish | Use `https://picsum.photos/seed/{name}/800/600` or local assets |
| Perfectly aligned testimonial cards with star ratings | Template pattern | Varied formats, pull quotes, inline mentions |
| Oversized H1s without proportional hierarchy below | Single-level typography signals "just make it big" | Scale the full type ramp: H1 through H4 with intentional ratio |
| Scroll-prompt filler UI ("Scroll to explore", "Swipe down", bouncing chevrons, scroll-arrow icons) | Signature AI landing-page tell; padding to avoid writing actual below-the-fold content | If content below is worth scrolling to, its first heading is the cue. Delete the prompt. |

## Falsifiable Tests

The pattern tables above catch known tells one at a time. These three tests catch the whole class -- run them against finished output before shipping.

- **Template test** -- swap in completely different content (a different product, different copy, different data). If the layout still makes sense without any structural change, a template was built, not a design. Redo it. A real design carries the fingerprint of its specific content; a template tolerates any payload.
- **AI Slop test** -- would a stranger glancing at only the first viewport immediately say "an AI made this"? If yes, the committed direction was not committed enough. Push the signature visual choice further until the answer is no.
- **Content authenticity tell** -- organic numbers beat round ones. Prefer `99.94%` over `99.99%`, `$99.00` over `$100.00`, `3.8x` over `10x`, `1,247` over `1,000`. Real metrics carry irregular digits; clean ones read as fabricated. No `John Doe` / `Jane Smith` users, no `Acme Corp` / `Nexus` brands -- placeholder content is the fastest authenticity failure to spot.
